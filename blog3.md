# Making No Progress Feels Like Progress

Almost a year ago I started my journey to build a company, to create something myself that I cared about. I wanted to learn how to code, how to ship. I wanted to branch out away from cryptocurrency as my only success, and make something that had a tangible impact.

Now looking back nothing has come. And I can’t even cope and have to be mad at myself because I really didn’t put the work in. I got distracted once again, the same as it has been since I started college.

I won’t blame college for this either though as all decisions have been my doing, but opening myself up for as many direct options has been tough. Just being able to balance the enjoyment and feeling of I can only experience this once with I need to make it right now has been a struggle.

I should look back though and see what I have done I guess. I got an internship at Johnson and Johnson, and was able to get done with all of my classes at university.

I want to imagine myself at a big tech job, working on a side hustle and just having a situation where I know I can strive but also have support to fall back on in case something goes wrong.

I have my passion back though, and I want to believe that it lasts this time. In reality my life could be just skiing, rock climbing, and coding.

Doesn't sound bad at all. And I’ve started to actualize these plans over the past week.

As long as this pattern stays consistent I am happy, it means I am at the very least staying on track with my goals.
